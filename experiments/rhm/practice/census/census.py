"""census — can an endogenous gauge buy the coverage the certificate cannot see?

FORK NOTICE. This file forks `../spiral/spiral.py` VERBATIM and adds four things, each marked
`# [census]` at its insertion point. `spiral/` and everything upstream of it are NOT modified.

  1. THE G-Y INSTRUMENT — an unpriced, read-only level-4 miner in EVERY arm, decoupled from
     `max_macro_level` (which caps what may be COMMITTED, not what may be OBSERVED). Phase 0
     established this stream is not in `sp_s0`'s logs at all and cannot be reconstructed from
     them: no level-4 miner is ever built, and per-key counts carry no adjacency. Level 4 stays
     unearnable (1,024 entries, ~384 cycles to cover) so this is a growth-DIRECTION readout and
     never a commit candidate. `gy_soundness()` checks it against hand-enumerated counts.

  2. COMMIT-THEN-EXTEND (`census_extend`) — the recert loop widened to every COMMITTED level in
     every era, and given the power to ADD post-commit mined entries to a frozen table instead
     of only offering whole-table swaps (which never fired in `sp_s0`: 0 swaps in 26 recerts).
     Entries enter by SELECTION, not append: each candidate is auditioned on fresh held-out
     instances of the era's own cell, priced, and admitted only if it does not raise the
     table's audition error. Phase 0's reason for the widening: the inherited loop fires only
     for `rc_level = era["level"]`, so it runs in eras 2-3 and **not at all in eras 4-5** —
     which are exactly where this round's payoff is measured.

  3. THE L2 GATE (`census_gate`) — a CONJUNCTION rule at level 2: commit when the certificate
     has fired AND the admission-rate gauge is quiet (G-A on the at-support series, W=12,
     theta=0, Phase 0 R5). A conjunction, not a replacement, so the op is strictly "hold longer
     than the certificate", `yoked_delay` is exactly interpretable as delay-alone, and no
     setting can accidentally ACCELERATE the commit. The gate is at L2 and not L3 because
     Phase 0 measured that a frozen L2 of recall r caps buildable L3 coverage at about r**2
     (0.327 in the routed arms), while L2 coverage on offer is +0.357 recall.

  4. `yoked_delay` — commits at the cycle `census_gate` actually committed, by clock rather
     than by signal. The cycle is not hard-coded: `census_run` runs `census_gate` first and
     passes its measured L2 commit cycle in, recording which case occurred (gate fired, or
     gate fell back to the era boundary).

Everything else is `spiral.py`'s, unchanged — which is what `fidelity_smoke` and the in-tag
`spiral_route` anchor assert.

spiral — the LIVE RE-EARNING SPIRAL on the depth-6 substrate.

FORK NOTICE. This file forks `../native/full/full.py` VERBATIM and then adds three things,
each marked `# [spiral]` at its insertion point. `native/`, `tall/`, `ear/`, `recital/` and
`ratchet/` are NOT modified; nothing is copied out of them except where a comment says so.

  1. THE DEPTH-6 TRANSPLANT (`tall/tall.py`'s lessons, not its code). `_spiral_shared` is
     `tall`'s `_tall_shared` idiom applied to THIS file's own `build_shared`: it populates
     `probe_clean` — the key every round's ENTRYPOINT populates and no builder does, which
     cost `tall` a ~510 s setup to discover — and then ASSERTS the complete key set that
     `run_arm` / `measure_refs` / `plant_probe` read, so interface drift fails in seconds
     instead of after a paid setup. `preflight` calls every one of those at toy sizes for the
     same reason. The grammar itself is a cfg substitution (`depth=6, m=2`), so with the
     transplant OFF this file is depth-4 `full.py` — which is what `fidelity_d4` gates.

  2. THE COMMIT POLICY, transplanted from `ear/ear.py` (and carried by `recital/recital.py`):
     CERTIFY-ELSE-PROVISIONAL-AT-BOUNDARY (`commit="delta_prov"`) plus the LIVE RECERT.
     `full.py`'s run loop is ratchet-lineage with a fixed in-tag commit schedule
     (`delta` / `early` / `late`), so the boundary-provisional policy is genuinely absent here
     and had to be written in, not switched on. A provisional commit deliberately skips the
     priced pre-commit audition — you pay to grade the unit where it is CONSUMED instead — and
     the recert grades the frozen unit on the next era's cell against what the live table
     would score. Both branches are additive: an arm whose `commit` is `delta`/`early`/`late`
     and whose spec has no `recert` key takes exactly `full.py`'s path, byte for byte.

  3. THE SPIRAL ARMS and the Phase-A instruments: the descent gate WITH ROUTING LIVE
     (`n_corrupt=1`, `tall/dens0`'s measured lever, folded into `build_shared` rather than
     bolted on afterwards), the commit-cycle PRICING READOUT (does `dens0`'s +0.180
     commit penalty survive when width refits under effective branching k instead of under
     |action set|?), and `tall`'s per-cycle entry-identity miner instrument.

WHY THE ROUND EXISTS: earn level k live from the beam's own chosen trajectories, consolidate
it at commit (pi's action space grows; span slots open behind the per-macro parity gate), then
earn level k+1 natively over the routed policy — and ask whether the crank accelerates, holds,
or decays per turn. See `SPEC.md` in this folder.

full — PHASE 2 of `native`: the two ports COMPOSED, plus the ablation battery.

FORK NOTICE, and the choice behind it. This file forks `../prop/prop.py` (Port 1), which is
itself a verbatim fork of `../../ratchet/ratchet.py`, and grafts Port 2 onto it by IMPORTING
`../span/span_net.py` — nothing is copied from `span/`, and `ratchet/`, `teacher_slot/`,
`prop/` and `span/` are all left untouched. The alternative was to re-fork `ratchet.py` and
import both nets; forking `prop.py` was chosen because Port 1's insertions are the larger and
more delicate of the two (a rewritten beam with a cached-encoder-state contract and a fidelity
gate that has already been verified bit-for-bit in-tag), while Port 2's are a clean seam — one
executor object threaded through the beam's materialisation call. Re-deriving Port 1 by hand
would have put the already-gated half at risk to save nothing.

WHAT IS NEW relative to `prop.py`:

 * The executor seam. `beam_moves` and `beam_moves_prop` both materialise through an executor
   object (`span_net.PlainExecutor` / `SpanExecutor`) instead of calling `macros.apply_any`
   directly. A `PlainExecutor` call IS `apply_any` (span/'s gate S-3), so an untreated arm is
   op-for-op ratchet and Port 1's beam is op-for-op `prop.py`'s.
 * `finetune_generator_span` — the plant loss plus the span head's self-imitation term in the
   same optimizer steps, with a `lam == 0` short-circuit that restores the original graph
   exactly (this is what makes the composed fidelity arm a real gate).
 * The NATIVE arms: proposal head (k = 4, Port 1's measured sweet spot) AND span head on the
   same vocabulary — `given_native`, `practice_late_native`.
 * The POISON PAIR: `practice_early` (a frozen 1-entry bogus level-2 table, exogenously
   enumerated) against `practice_early_prop_k4` (the same bad table, natively ROUTED).
 * `ablation_battery` — an end-of-run probe battery on the final trained state, per arm:
   (a) full system, (b) table ablated with macro calls forced through the span head,
   (b') table and span reach both removed, (c) primitives ablated. Plus, under each, the
   next-level mining yield split into its STRUCTURAL component (entries `Miner.build` can
   assemble over the surviving lower table) and its INFORMATIVE one (distinct level-1 tuples
   observed at support in the chosen trajectories, which no lower table gates).

The fork's fidelity is not assumed: the untreated arms are re-run IN THIS TAG as the twins,
and `given_fid` (k = n_moves, span loss off, parity gate nailed shut) is carried as an in-tag
assertion that the composed loop reproduces enumeration bit-for-bit for 90 cycles.

WHAT IS NEW (everything else is ratchet's, unchanged):

 * `prop_net.ProposalHead` — pi(move | z, r*) beside the value, on the SAME encoder read
   (`controller.state(x)` plus the root target), over a fixed (level, node) slot vocabulary.
 * `beam_moves_prop` — at plan time only the top-k proposed moves per tip are materialised and
   scored, instead of all `n_moves`. Everything else about the beam is `beam_moves` verbatim.
   The kept children's encoder states are CACHED and reused as the next step's proposal read,
   because the value already paid for them when it scored those children.
 * `prop_train` — self-imitation on the beam's own chosen trajectories: (state, r*) -> the move
   the surviving-and-SOLVED tip actually took, masked cross-entropy over the live action set.
   Selection happens before the regression, which is the whole reason this is not "gradient
   descent averaging over everything the agent did".
 * Arms `*_prop_k{1,2,4,N}` over three vocabularies (base / true / mined), and the readouts the
   spec commits Port 1 to: the can't-decompose signature, the effective-branching ledger, and
   the next-level currency under native vs exogenous routing.

WHAT IS PRICED, SAID OUT LOUD. A grounding in this substrate is "score one state" — an encoder
pass plus a value read (`beam_moves` charges one per materialised child). The proposal head
reads the SAME z. For every tip below the root that z was already computed and charged when the
value scored that state as a child, so the port caches it and the ledger charges nothing; the
head-only forward on a cached vector is counted separately as `n_prop` and priced at `c_prop`
(default 0.0, with a sensitivity column at c_mat = 0.05 in the reduction). The ROOT state is
the one honest exception — it has never been anybody's child — so the port pays one full
grounding per instance per solve for it, and `fit_width_k` sees that cost when it picks the
width. The freed groundings are REINVESTED, not banked: each arm runs the widest beam that fits
the same declared G = 58 under ITS effective branching factor, which is exactly ratchet's
matched-pricing idiom with n_moves -> k. The banked reading (same width, fewer groundings) is
recoverable from the width ladder logged at every probe.

Round 2 of the practice arc on RHM. Round 1 (`../crystallize/`) found the compile certificate
VACUOUS on a frozen plant: practice trained the judge (the value) while the generator that
executes a committed unit never moved, so the committable content was flat from cycle 1 and
committing at cycle 1 was optimal at 26x less priced time. Its precheck (`calp_s0`) validated
the fix — let the plant learn on the agent's own successful repairs and the committed-unit
ceiling moves at 31-66x the metering noise floor.

WHAT THIS ROUND COMPOSES.

 1. A LEARNING PLANT, carried by every arm. The generator fine-tunes online on configurations
    the agent actually solved (replay 0.5 against the clean setup pool), and the value adapts
    online against it — round 1's precheck confound (its wide beam degraded because the value
    was trained against the old generator) fixed by construction.

 2. A DEPTH-LADDERED DAMAGE SCHEDULE, the `level_ladder` idiom: the damage cell moves one level
    deeper per era, through NESTED cells (L1 n6 subset L2 n3 subset L3 n1), so era k+1's error
    is literally era k's error one level up. At a declared per-solve grounding budget, a level-3
    error is four blocks wide and a base-move agent must spend its whole move budget on it with
    no coordination left over — climbing is necessary, not merely available.

 3. AN EARNED VOCABULARY (`macros.py`). The committed unit is not a whole-solve program (round
    1's unit) but a MACRO ACTION: the same max-sum operator the true level move uses, over a
    table MINED from the agent's own solved configurations and parsed by the agent's own
    generator. Committing it puts a new primitive in the practice action space — the beam
    proposes it, the value scores it, the plant's fine-tuning sees trajectories that use it.
    The level-l table is defined over level-(l-1) ENTRIES, so an incomplete committed level-2
    vocabulary is a hard cap on level 3: the poisoned-region test with a mechanism.

 4. A UNIT-LP CERTIFICATE. Round 1's central lesson, in Jasper's constructive form: certify on
    the LEARNING PROGRESS OF THE COMMITTABLE CONTENT — the shadow-audition trajectory of the
    candidate macro, positive and then flat — never on task-performance level or task-LP, which
    conflate selector and plant improvement. "Positive and then flat" is enforced: silence alone
    cannot certify unless the audition has first descended by `lp_min_drop`.

ARMS differ ONLY in vocabulary-acquisition policy:
    never_base     base level-1 moves forever; must buy depth with search at the declared budget
    given          the DGP's own level-2/3 tables from cycle 1 (the `level_moves` ceiling)
    practice_gated earns them, gated by the unit-LP certificate
    practice_early commits one cycle into each era (minimal coverage) -- the poison test
    practice_late  commits at each era's end (the rent-paying control)

    """`beam_moves` with the enumeration replaced by a proposal.

    Structurally line-for-line the original: same children ordering (tip-major, move-minor),
    same `topk` over value scores, same parent/seq bookkeeping, same final re-score. The only
    changes are (i) which children exist at all, and (ii) that the kept children's encoder
    states are carried forward instead of being recomputed for the proposal read.

    `slots` maps position-in-`ms` -> slot id, so the head's output vocabulary is stable across
    an action set that grows at a commit. `forced` is a list of positions in `ms` that are
    expanded unconditionally (a move too new for the head to have a training example on).

    FIDELITY. At k >= len(ms) with `forced` empty, `select_moves` returns `arange(n_moves)` for
    every tip, `expand_selected`'s row gather is the identity, and the assembled child tensor,
    the scores, the topk and the sequences are the enumerated ones bit-for-bit. The only
    difference is the extra root encode, which is charged and touches nothing else."""

    Three things are asserted, all at sizes small enough to count by hand:

      1. SPAN. A level-`level` miner keys on `s**(level-1)` level-1 features — 8 blocks at
         level 4, s=2. Wrong span means the instrument is silently counting a different object.
      2. COUNTS. Feed a hand-built array with a known multiset of rows and check `n_distinct`,
         `n_obs` and `n_at_support` at every threshold against the hand count. This is what
         catches a keying bug (e.g. keying on positions instead of values, or collapsing rows).
      3. NODE INDEXING. For every era of the real ladder, the level-`level` node the instrument
         reads must be in range (`s**(depth-level)` nodes exist) and its column slice must lie

    #            call the address — but nothing may consult the table at execution time, so
    #            every macro call is served by the span head. POLICY, ON THE RECORD: under this
    #            condition the head serves ALL macro calls regardless of the parity gate, so a
    #            parity shortfall shows up as error rather than being hidden behind a fallback
    #            to the very DP path the condition is supposed to have removed. Arms with no

    #   built        entries `Miner.build` can assemble over the surviving lower table. Under

    #   at_support   distinct level-1 tuples observed at least `mine_support` times in the
    #                chosen trajectories, keyed by the flat tuple and gated by no table at all.
    #                This is the INFORMATIVE half: does the observation stream of chunk-shaped

# [spiral] PHASE B — the main run
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# The sized ladder. Levels/nodes are `tall`'s nested cells; the third field is that era's own
# cycle count, from OFFLINE DETECTOR REPLAY on Phase A's own logged audition series plus the
# arc's ~50% margin convention — not from round numbers, and deliberately not from `cal0`'s
# clock-paced figures, which the replay shows are optimistic at this depth.
#
#   THE REPLAY, and why it changed the sizing. Phase A's `sil run` was 0 at every cycle, which
#   looks like a dead detector and is not: its arms committed at c16 under `commit="late"`,
#   and the donor's certificate stops being evaluated the moment a level commits. Re-running
#   the silence test offline over the full 22-cycle audition series (`log["cert"]["A"]`, the
#   same series the shadow certificate reads) at this round's constants
#   (sil_c 0.06 / sil_cv 0.15 / lp_min_drop 0.10):
#
#       L2 certificate fires at c19 (enum arm) and c21 (routed arm).
#
#   `cal0` predicted c12 for L2, so depth-6 certification is ~1.6-1.75x later than the
#   clock-paced calibration suggested. That ratio is the sizing input.
#
#   era 1 (earns L2), 32 cycles — max replayed firing c21, x1.5 margin = 32. 28 would have
#     truncated the L2 certificate, which is exactly the 30-cycle-truncation mistake
#     `ratchet`/`ear` made and `tall`'s design doc warns against repeating. At 32 the L2 commit
#     should be CERTIFIED rather than provisional-at-boundary, and there are ~11 cycles left in
#     the era for the corridor to start accumulating parity data before era 2 begins.
#   era 2 (earns L3), 56 cycles — the binding constraint of the run. `cal0` saw L3 at c22;
#     scaled by the measured 1.7x and given the same 1.5x margin, 53-58. The mining-coverage
#     floor (~24 cycles at mine_cap=8) sits comfortably inside it, and the remaining headroom
#     is spent here on purpose: this is where BOTH the L3 crank and the corridor wall live (a
#     span slot needs ~4 cycles past commit to reach a first parity read at span_min_hold=128,
#     and a parity TRAJECTORY needs many more than one read).
#   eras 3-5 (consumption; L4+ is not earnable at any affordable budget), 12/9/7 — long enough
#     for at least two probes each at probe_every=8, which is what a stable cost-to-depth read
#     needs, and no longer: nothing can be earned there.
#
# 116 cycles/arm. At Phase A's measured per-cycle costs (8.1-13.1 s routed/enum at n=32; 23.4
# s/cycle for the 56-move `given`/`fid` shapes) plus the four extra all-eras probe beams a

    `calr_s0` measured a plant that does not move: parse/infill accuracy flat to three
    decimals over 48 cycles, the true-table audition trendless, and at gen_lr 3e-4 actively
    degrading. The cause is that the fine-tuning diet is IN DISTRIBUTION -- solved
    configurations are ordinary clean derivations, and replay 0.5 is against the same corpus,
    so there is nothing to learn. Round 1 solved the same problem for the *value* by training
    it on a distribution that excluded the contexts it would be metered on; this does it for
    the *plant*.

    `plant_holdout` withholds level-2 tuples from the setup corpus while the evaluation
    instances keep coming from the unfiltered DGP. Every era's damage requires producing a
    correct level-2 tuple, so the plant's hole and the vocabulary's hole are the same hole.

    THE GATE (and it is a gate, not a knob): on instances that REQUIRE a withheld tuple,
    bootstrap solvability must be low but NONZERO. A frontier the agent can never cross is not
    a learner regime, it is exploration-gating by another name, and a ~0 reading is a
    halt-and-report rather than something to tune around."""

    P-1  `select_moves` at k = n_moves returns `arange(n_moves)` for EVERY row, including rows
         of exact ties (a zero-init head gives exactly that) — the tie-ordering hazard the spec
         names, closed by a stable sort rather than by `topk`.
    P-2  `expand_selected` at k = n_moves is BIT-IDENTICAL to the enumerated
         `stack([apply_any(flat, ms[j]) for j], 1)`.
    P-3  `beam_moves_prop` at k = n_moves reproduces `beam_moves` bit-for-bit — same final
         states, same tips, same move sequences, same materialisation and grounding counts
         apart from the one root encode the port pays for and declares.
    P-4  building the head consumes NONE of the global torch stream (the twin gate's
         precondition): the random draw after `build_head` equals the draw without it.
    P-5  the head is exactly uniform at init (zero-init output layer), so a freshly committed
         macro enters the ranking neutrally rather than at an arbitrary trained logit.
    P-6  `select_moves` at k < n_moves returns exactly the k highest-logit moves, ascending,
         and with `forced` returns k + |forced| including every forced index.
    P-7  the (level, node) slot layout is injective over the full 14-move action set, and the
         pricing table `fit_width_k` the k ladder rests on (printed, not asserted).

    And the COMPOSITION's own gates, which are what this phase adds:

    C-1  `PlainExecutor` is `macros.apply_any` on every move, and a non-firing `SpanExecutor`
         is too — so threading an executor through the beam changes nothing by itself.
    C-2  THE COMPOSED FIDELITY GATE: the proposal beam at k = n_moves with a span executor
         present but closed reproduces the enumerating beam bit-for-bit (x, seq, tips, traj,
         materialisation count), the only delta being the declared root encode.
    C-3  an OPEN span slot rewrites exactly the macro's own token positions and nothing else,
         through the composed beam's own executor.
    C-4  minting BOTH heads leaves the shared torch stream exactly where it was — the twin
         gate's precondition, now for two new RNG consumers rather than one."""

    cycles), not at `sp_s0`'s configuration. A full-scale in-process replay would mean paying
    for three 116-cycle depth-6 arms plus a ~630 s setup — about 1.5 GPU-h to re-derive a
    number the in-tag anchor gives away free. The FULL-SCALE half of G-F is therefore the
    cross-tag one, in `analyze_census.py`: this round's in-tag `spiral_route` against
    `sp_s0`'s, over the 32 cycles the two ladders share. Era 1 is 48 cycles here against 32
    there, but the only things `ec` reaches are the loop bound, `at_boundary` (c18's certified
    commit precedes both), and the era-end probe trigger (which fires at c32 either way, and
    probes consume neither the shared torch stream nor any arm RNG). So c1-c32 is a genuine

    1. SETUP + REFERENCES at depth 6, m=2, `n_corrupt=1` — the densified stale value buffer is
       built by `build_shared` itself, so its terminal success is reported beside `dens0`'s
       0.133 and depth 4's 0.296 without any retraining step.
    2. THE DESCENT GATE WITH ROUTING LIVE. Era 1 only, `cycles` cycles, three arms sharing one
       torch stream: enumeration (the in-run reproduction of `dens0`'s −0.004/cycle reference),
       routing only, and both ports. Recovered fraction, its c1 decomposition, and the
       pre-commit slope — the part the loop is responsible for.
    3. THE COMMIT-CYCLE PRICING READOUT. The commit is placed at a FIXED cycle in every arm
       (`commit="late"` with `late_offset = cycles - commit_at`) rather than left to the
       certificate, precisely so the arms' pricing transitions are at the same cycle and the
       comparison is a comparison. The transplanted `delta_prov` policy is what the MAIN run
       uses; it is exercised by `preflight` and by the `spiral` arm shape, not here, because a
       certificate that fires at different cycles in different arms would confound the one
       number this block exists to read.
    4. THE IN-TAG FIDELITY TWINS AT DEPTH 6: `fid` (both ports wired, both nailed shut) against
       `given` (plain enumeration), same stream, `fid_cycles` cycles, asserted bit-for-bit.
    5. TASK-MATCHED COLLECTION DAMAGE (`task_matched`), the one untested densification lever
       `tall` named: collect the generic value buffer with damage drawn from the ERA'S OWN cell
       (`corrupt_hier` at the era's level/node) instead of `_corrupt`'s random blocks, and
       report its terminal success against `n_corrupt=1`'s. A measurement only — nothing is
       trained on it here — so Phase B can adopt it on evidence rather than on argument."""
